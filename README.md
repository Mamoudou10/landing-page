# 🌐 Landing Page - The Odin Project

This is a **Landing Page** project I built as part of my learning journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
It allowed me to apply the fundamentals of **HTML** and **CSS** that I’ve learned so far.

- Structure a web page using **semantic HTML**.
- Style elements with **CSS**.
- Practice the **box model** concept.
- Use **Flexbox** for layout and alignment.
- Understand the importance of **visual hierarchy**, **spacing**, and **basic responsive design**.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
